Reactor 3D Game Engine - Reiser Games

The Reactor 3D Game Engine was originally written with XNA/C# for cross-platform windows/xbox360 gaming.
Over 2 years worth of development has gone into it but I must say that it is lacking
in a few features here and there.  Overall it's enough to get anyone started using XNA
and developing for Windows and XBox 360.  Recently, I ported it to MonoGame to support
cross-platform development on Windows, Linux, Mac OSX, Android, iOS, and Windows Phone.

A game called Alchemist was released on XBox Live Indy Games in 2009 using this game engine.

Originally I was going to port it all to C++/OpenGL but found the task too daunting.  Luckily
the MonoGame guys came around and I was able to reuse all this code.

Hopefully I can add more features and make this a more feature complete engine.  It will take time
but I'm optimistic about the possibilities.
